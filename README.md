## 1. Capstone Project - Battle of the Neighborhoods - Moving to Palm Beach County, Florida
### Jupyter Notebook: 
Battle of the Neighborhoods.ipynb

### Description :
Currently trending, many active seniors, especially those who live in states like New York and New Jersey, once retired, look to relocate to a warmer, less expensive location like Florida. They would like to move to an area where they can still enjoy many of the same activities in their new home as they enjoyed in their northern one, while maintaining a comparable quality of life in terms of affordability and demographics.

An important consideration for active seniors is to move to an area that is close to family and friends, as well as an area that their guests, including grandchildren, can enjoy visiting. For this study, that area will be limited to Palm Beach County, Florida. Palm Beach County is a large area - 2,386 square miles - on the east coast of Florida consisting of 39 municipalities.

Although there are many factors to consider when moving to a new neighborhood such as available social activities, recreational activities, access to healthcare, as well as the crime rate, taxes, affordability, and public amenities including transportation, this study will focus on venue data collected by Foursquare.

Foursquare provides a variety of categories of venues such as restaurants, shopping, and leisure activities. This study will cluster neighborhoods (municipalities) in Palm Beach County, Florida by venues collected from Foursquare. In addition, median income, median property value, population density, and area (square miles) data will be collected and analyzed.

The goal of the analysis is to provide seniors with information that will help them make a better determination as to which areas they should explore further when considering relocation to Palm Beach County, Florida.

This project utilizes K Means to cluster neighborhoods. Three clusters are identified and analyzed.
